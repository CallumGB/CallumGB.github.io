          <p class="lead">The first of Harry's adventures and the beginning of the Tracy Sollis Leukaemia Trust



<p>It was on 5th May 1998 that Sue Sollis, the Founder Member of The Tracy Sollis Leukaemia Trust, travelled the length of the country to raise funds.  </p>

<p>Travelling completely alone, apart from the company of 'Harry Hedgehog' (The Trust's mascot) the journey took 21 days.</p>

<p>There were a few detours to the planned route, due to unexpected circumstances.  Sue now relates her experiences to various clubs and organisations in return for donations to The Trust.  She is on the Worcestershire Womens Institute's list of approved guest speakers.</p>

<p>Sue recounted the undertaking and successful achievement of her journey from Land's End to John-o-Groats on a moped to Wychbold WIat their 2006 at the Christmas meeting.</p>
<p>They were not surprised to learn that even this mind-boggling distance was not quite enough for our heroine - she added a paltry couple of hundred miles by a detour to Peterborough to join a rally of motorcycles, at which she was invited to lead the procession through the city on her moped, with the motorbikers in their leathers and goggles supporting her.</p>

          <p class="lead">Harry joined Sue to take part in a parachute jump in 1997 to raise funds for the Trust.</p>
<p>A cheque presentation made by 'Bourton on Trent Police Force', led to Founder Member of The Tracy Sollis Leukaemia Trust, Sue Sollis, participating in a Skydive. The police who had raised funds for the Trust by undertaking a parachute jump, challenged Sue to a similar experience. </p>
<p>Despite a great fear of heights, Sue underwent the challenge on 15th May 1997 with a Skydive from 12,500 feet. The jump took place at The Army Parachute Association's base in Netheravon Wiltshire and jumping tandem with Sergeant Debbie Ingle, Sue leapt from the Red Devils Plane falling at 120 miles per hour. The jump raised £3,000.</p>
<p>
Harry fancied joining in with the Skydive. A special harness was attached to him him and he was strapped to Founder Member of The Trust's Sue Sollis's waist.  It was the first time a hedgehog had attempted such a feat! </p>

          <p>Britain's strongest man, Russ Bradley, pulled a tractor complete with a trailer, carrying 18 children, 14 bales of hay, Father Christmas and not forgetting Harry Hedgehog . The mammoth pull covered a distance of 100yards raising £3,000 towards the Trust back in 1997. Harry said "It was a very emotional occasion with the music 'Simply the Best' playing in the background. It was enough to make a Hedgehog's prickles stand on end." </p>
